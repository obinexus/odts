## **Formal Problem Statement via ODTS Framwork for AURASEAL**

We define a telemetry-integrated **state resolution functor**
[
F : H_e \cup H_o \to \Sigma
]
where:

* ( H_e ) = set of **heterogeneous operations** (dynamic, context-dependent transitions)
* ( H_o ) = set of **homogeneous operations** (static, deterministic transitions)
* ( \Sigma ) = encoded system state space over natural binary domain ( N = {0, 1} )

The function ( F ) encodes **state recognition** and **resolution** as a directed inference graph governed by seeded pseudo-random dynamics.

---

### **State Domain Definitions**

Let:
[
H_e = { [0, 1], [1, 0] }, \quad H_o = { [0, 0], [1, 1] }
]

Each ordered pair represents a **transition vector** between binary states (i.e., a minimal transition matrix over ( \mathbb{B}^2 )).

The state transitions occur under a **seeded system evolution** governed by a PRNG-derived function:
[
S_{n+1} = (aS_n + c) \bmod m
]
where ( a, c, m \in \mathbb{N} ) and ( S_0 ) is the **cryptographic seed**.
This represents the pseudo-random behavior driving system perturbations or “telemetry noise.”

### **Functorial Mapping**

The functor ( F ) preserves the compositional structure of the system:
[
F(X \times U) = F(X) \times F(U)
]
where:

* ( X ) is the **execution state** of the system (e.g., user or machine operation)
* ( U ) is the **union** or **interaction domain** (e.g., telemetry, data flow, or user input)
* The cross-product ( X \times U ) models **entanglement of control and data flow**

Bidirectional inference is defined as:
[
X \leftrightarrow U
]
which expands into:
[
(X \to U) \land (U \to X)
]
representing **mutual dependency** between system and observation.

### **Error State Classification**

Define an error signal space ( E \subseteq \mathbb{R} ) partitioned by **severity intervals**:

| Range | Label     | Semantic Meaning                  |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1–5   | WARNING   | Recoverable anomaly               |
| 6–11  | DANGER    | Functional degradation            |
| 12–17 | CRITICAL  | System compromise potential       |
| 18–23 | CRITICAL+ | Escalating fault or cascade       |
| 24–29 | PANIC     | Catastrophic or unbounded failure |

Each error state ( e_i \in E ) maps to a **telemetry response function**:
[
T(e_i) = F(H_e \cup H_o) + \epsilon
]
where ( \epsilon ) represents system “jitter” or entropy introduced by the PRNG seed.

### **Human-in-the-Loop Detection**

Define a binary predicate ( \mathcal{H}(x) ) indicating **human loop state**:
[
\mathcal{H}(x) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if human actively influences transition (in-the-loop)} \
0 & \text{if human detached or automated process dominates (out-of-loop)}
\end{cases}
]

“Malicious loop” detection arises when:
[
\exists x : \mathcal{H}(x) = 1 \wedge \nabla F(x) \text{ diverges}
]
meaning: human input induces **non-recoverable state drift**.

---

### **Objective**

Formally, the system seeks to:
[
\min_{\text{seed},,a,,c} ; \mathbb{E}\left[ \text{Error}(F(H_e,H_o,N)) \right]
]
subject to:
[
\text{Stability}(F) \geq \tau
]
for threshold ( \tau ), ensuring bounded behavior across random perturbations.
